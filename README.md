# Vrinda-Store-EDA
Second Data Analytics Project
## This was my first Excel Data Analytics project, and I learned many new functions of Excel.
Learned how to clean data, make pivot tables,  graphs and slicers and learn about the true potential of Excel which is simple and easy to learn.
In this project, I have used stored data to complete this project.
## Question answered after the analysis.
In which month does the store get the most orders the customers that order regularly, and the amount spent by each customer?
What gender regularly buys things from the store and the amount spent by them?
What are the top 5 states people that regularly purchase from the shop?
Which channel delivery delivered most of the products? What is the order status of the product Is a number of products delivered, refunded, returned, or cancelled?
